          Emocare Lotion, with its combination of Shea butter and glycerin,
          offers several benefits for your skin. Shea butter is known for its
          moisturizing properties, helping to lock in hydration, soothe dryness
          and create a protective barrier. Glycerin is a humectant that draws
          moisture from the air to your skin, keeping it hydrated and preventing
